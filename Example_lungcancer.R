#####Fit the flexible AFT model###

## Input for FlexAFT function:
# Data: dataset (no missing data allowed; categorial variables have to be coded as dummy variables)
# Var: names of the independent variables to be included in the flexible AFT model
# NL: indicate for each variable if the NL effect is modeled (0/1) 
#     Can be 1 only for continuous variables
# TD: indicate for each variable if the TD effect is modeled (0/1)
# nknot.NL: number of interior knots of the splines for NL effects. Put NA when no NL effect for a variable
# nknot.TD: number of interior knots of the splines for TD effects. Put NA when no TD effect for a variable
# degree.NL: degree of the splines for NL effects. Put NA when no NL effect for a variable
# degree.TD: degree of the splines for TD effects. Put NA when no TD effect for a variable
# nknot.bh: number of interior knots of the splines for modeling the baseline hazard
# degree.bh: degree of the splines for modeling the baseline hazard
# Time.Obs: name of the observed time variable
# (NOTE: convert the time variable to years or months, instead of days, can help reduce potentially long computation time)
# Delta: name of the event indicator
# knot_time: "eventtime" or "alltime" specifying whether the knots are placed based on the quantiles of the uncensored event times or the overall observed (event or censoring) times. The default is "alltime".
# tol: convergence criterion evaluating two consecutive log-likelihood. The default is 1^-5
# ndivision: the number of intervals defining the granularity of the numerical computation of integrals.
# The range of the integral is divided by ndivision small intervals.
# The larger the number is, the longer the estimation takes.
# The default value is 100*floor(max(Time.Obs)) and can be requested by ndivision="maxtime".  
# When deciding a customized value for ndivision for the trade-off between precision and computation time,
# one may take into account the maximum of Time.Obs and how precise the event is being recorded.
# For example, if the maximum of Time.Obs is 3 years and the precision of event times is recorded in months,
# then one may choose ndivision=36, so that the numerical integration uses one month for each interval.
# If the maximum of Time.Obs is 3 years and the precision of event times is recorded in days, 
# then we need a better granularity for the numerical computation.
# One may choose ndivision=300, so that the numerical integration uses 3.65 days for each interval ((3*365)/300).
